# Help center for end users

The help center is designed to provide end users with a complete self-service support option. They can get information from the knowledge base or turn to the community, if available, for answers. If they can't find an answer, they can submit a request to an agent.

## Anatomy of the help center

The help center can consist of a knowledge base and a community platform.

You can use search to find information in both the knowledge base and the community at the same time. The search results are displayed in two columns, with one column listing the knowledge base results and the other listing the community results.
